    "Need to forecast concentrations of 7 chemicals that react with each other:\n",

    "(Note: {01'} is the combination of CB6 reactions {01} and {02}. )\n",
    "\n",
    "By neglecting the chemicals in ( ), this has the effect of reducing the\n",
    "order of the reaction. Also, we will assume h·nu is a known constant.\n",
    "The following are essentially 1st order reactions: {01, 09}.\n",
    "The following are essentially 2nd order reactions: {03, 11, 25, 123}.\n",

    "Let [ ] be the concentration of a chemical in units of molecules/cm^3.\n",
    "Rate equations predict the change in concentration [ ] of chemicals\n",

    "  1st order photolysis of A -> C.     Rate eq is:  d[C]/dt = j*[A]\n",
    "  2nd order reaction of A + B -> C.   Rate eq is:  d[C]/dt = k*[A]*[B]\n",
    "where\n",
    "  \"photolysis rate constant\" j has units of (s^-1)\n",
    "  \"reaction rate constant\"   k has units of ( (s * molecules/cm^3)^-1 )\n",
    "Although j varies with solar elevation, cloudiness, etc.,\n",
    "we will assume j = constant for simplicity in this exercise.\n",
    "\n",

    "{25.0}   Define R25 = k25*[HO2]*[NO]\n",
    "{25.1}   d[OH]/dt = R25\n",
    "{25.2}   d[NO2]/dt = R25\n",
